By default, Markdown written in SiYuan is formatted Markdown text that conforms to the standard syntax, which can be directly copied and pasted to other places.

After copying from other places (such as Web pages, Word, Excel), you can also directly paste it in SiYuan, and the copied content will be automatically converted into Markdown text.
